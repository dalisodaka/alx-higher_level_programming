Python Basics and Data Structures README
Python Print
Printing in Python is a fundamental concept for displaying information. Use the print() function to output text, variables, or expressions to the console. For example:

python
Copy code
print("Hello, Python!")
Integer
In Python, an integer is a whole number without a fractional component. You can perform various operations on integers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example:

python
Copy code
num1 = 5
num2 = 3
sum_result = num1 + num2
print("Sum:", sum_result)
Print Float
Floats in Python represent real numbers and can include a decimal point. Printing floats is similar to printing integers. For example:

python
Copy code
float_num = 3.14
print("Float Number:", float_num)
Print String
Strings are sequences of characters in Python. You can print strings directly or concatenate them with other strings. For example:

python
Copy code
name = "Python"
print("Programming with " + name)
Copy, Cut, Paste
In Python, copying, cutting, and pasting typically refer to manipulating data structures like lists. For instance, to copy a list:

python
Copy code
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
copied_list = original_list.copy()
To cut (remove) an element from a list and paste it into another:

python
Copy code
source_list = [1, 2, 3]
destination_list = []
element_to_cut = source_list.pop(1)  # Cut the element at index 1
destination_list.append(element_to_cut)  # Paste it to the destination list
Linked List
A linked list is a data structure composed of nodes connected in a linear sequence. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node. Implementing a linked list in Python involves defining a Node class and a LinkedList class. For example:

python
Copy code
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next_node = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current_node = self.head
            while current_node.next_node:
                current_node = current_node.next_node
            current_node.next_node = new_node
